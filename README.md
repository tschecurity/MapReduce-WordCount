# MapReduce-WordCount
 :bulb: Before starting the WordCount Program in Hadoop you will need a few items:
* A virtual machine manager
* A virtual machine
* A computer with a large amount of ram *over 10gb is recommended as the virtual machine itself can take up over 5gb of space on your computer.

You will need to understand or learn basic Shell commands to retrieve the wordcount file: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/file_system_shell.pdf.
First navigate to your temporary directory from the desktop. Access the command line, by right clicking in the desktop, navigating to the terminal. Confirm you are in the correct directory with the pwd command. 
This guide is very helpful in getting started with WordCount in MapReduce to extract word counts via a particular parameter: https://cse.buffalo.edu/~bina/cse487/spring2016/prj2/TutorialRS.pdf.
