# MapReduce-WordCount
 :bulb: Before starting the Word Count Program in Hadoop you will need a few items:
* A virtual machine manager
* A virtual machine
* A computer with a large amount of ram *over 10gb is recommended as the virual machine itself can take up over 5bg of space on your computer.

You will need to learn basic Linux commands to retrieve the wordcount file: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/file_system_shell.pdf.
First navigate to your temporary directory from the desktop. Access the linux command line, by right clicking in the desktop. Confirm you are in the correct directory with the pwd command. 
This guide is very helpful in getting started with a simplistic version of WordCount 1.0, to extract word counts via a particular parameter: http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Hadoop_Tutorial_1_--_Running_WordCount.
